IRT EXAMPLE: SIMULATED LOGISTIC MODEL TREE DATASET

Dataset is generated using a logistic regression model tree of depth 2 (see the Depth2Tree function).
This example runs our IRT tree-building algorithm on the dataset to test whether it accurately models the data.
Note that as an additional challenge to the IRT, the leaf nodes of the data-generating tree use logistic regression models
 (not isotonic regression models).

NOTE: for this to run properly, include the following import statement in mst.py: "from leaf_model_isoreg import *"
